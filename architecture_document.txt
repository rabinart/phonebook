# Phonebook
I decided to build this application in Java using only JDK to keep it simple.
For graphics, I will use the swing library, since JavaFX is no longer part of the JDK and is suitable for more complex tasks. 

The architecture of the application should make possible to expand the application, for example, add new functionality for a phonebook or implement a new user interface. 

So, there will be one class responsible for graphics. The main one, that implements the phonebook functionality. And the bridge between them.

Build tool is Gradle to make easier run source code on other machines just by using gradlew.bat(for Windows) or gradlew(for Linux) in the command line.
