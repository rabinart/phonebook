Scope of testing:
Phonebook.class

Phonebook test cases:
    1. Add 5 entries. Expect 5 entries in the phonebook, that also saved in resources directory
    2. Try to delete not existing number, then add this number and try to delete it again. Expect empty entry set
    3. Try to add already existing number, expect false
    4. Enter every possible wrong input in the put() and delete() method

Test directory: src/test/java/com/rabinart

Test Report:
Each "test" task generates index.html report in Test_report directory. It contains test coverage report.
For every failed test I would generate a log file with the stacktrace.
